               <p class="article-body">In today’s world, it feels like we’re always juggling — work, social media, family, friends, hobbies, and a never-ending list of things to do. With technology advancing and our expectations growing, we are constantly connected, always on the go, and often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of stuff — both physical and mental — in our lives. I wasn’t always a minimalist. In fact, I used to think the more stuff I had, the more "successful" or "happy" I would feel. I worked hard to achieve more: more clothes, more gadgets, more followers. But in the process, I started feeling more cluttered, more distracted, and honestly, more stressed.
               It was then I decided to hit the reset button. I began to declutter not just my physical space but my mental space as well. That’s when minimalism — a lifestyle focused on living with intention and having less to focus on the things that truly matter — entered my life.</p>
